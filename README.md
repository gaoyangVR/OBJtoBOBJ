# OBJtoBOBJ
This is a simple program for people who need transfer *.OBJ data to *.BOBJ for Blender rendering.

In blender, if one want use ‘physics-fluid-domain’ to render a series of frames, the *.BOBJ data will be used.
This program will help you transfer a series of OBJ files to BOBJ files for Blender.

Please put all the OBJ files into 'OBJdata' and name them from ‘bubble_0’ to 'bubble_1500', where 'bubble' is the name of OBJ file, you can change it to whatever else you like in the main function. And you can get sequence of BOBJ flies in 'OBJBdata'.

I hope this program will help you, and if it works, please reffer my paper
